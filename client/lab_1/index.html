        <p>Sometimes it's nice to write in <em>italics for attention</em></p>
        <p></p>
        <p>But, you can get more from <strong>writing in bold</strong></p>
        <p></p>
        <p>And, even more if you <em><strong>combine the two!</strong></em></p>

Empty Elements

Soft line breaks can't wrap anything. Neither can image tags, or hard lines.
Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.

Images 

Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.

Include a hyperlink here to your github repository for class.
If you want your repo to be private, be sure to invite Prof A as a "collaborator."
